# Emotion-detection
This repository contains code for training and evaluating deep learning models for emotion detection. The models are trained on the FER-2013 dataset, which is a commonly used dataset for emotion detection. The evaluation metric used is the ROC AUC score, which is a standard metric for evaluating the performance of binary classification models.

The repository includes code for training CNN, ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet, and MobileNet models. The code also includes code for evaluating the performance of the models on the FER-2013 dataset.

The repository is intended to be used as a starting point for researchers and developers who are interested in emotion detection with deep learning. The code is well-documented and easy to understand.

Here are some additional points that you could include in your description:

The repository is open source and available on GitHub.
The code is written in Python and uses the PyTorch framework.
The repository includes instructions for setting up the environment and running the code.
The repository is regularly updated with new features and improvements.
